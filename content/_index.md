# Selva Daşdemir

## About Me

I have a formal background in sociology, psychology, and Middle Eastern studies. My research interests span history, media studies, migration, memory studies, and digital anthropology. 

My work has been characterized by others as "memory activism" and "open source investigation" - bridging rigorous academic research with accessible public engagement. I translate complex social research into formats that reach diverse audiences, from viral documentary series to interactive exhibitions.

Currently applying for **MA Design & Computation** to enhance my technical capabilities for computational approaches to social research.
