# gain projects
*2020-2021*

for the newly founded digital platform gain, we did our first budgeted projects. this was a depressing time for me due to my disalignment with the platform, but they were still received well.

because it's behind a paywall, i can't share our several short contents that we produced for them. they were about basic, easy to digest topics such as history of some legendary songs, forgotten celebrities, one hit wonders, stolen hits etc.

we also produced 5 big documentaries for them. i did only one, which became recently available on youtube due to a legal loophole.

this series investigates the life and achievements of the 80's vamp sex symbol and 2000's "bimbo" - "the aphrodite of turkey", **banu alkan**. i was never a big fan of her or her work, but she was highly requested and her life story presented a way that we could investigate the class difference and mobilization in the 80s, sexuality and eroticism in 80s cinema, and the bimbo tv culture and sexism of 2000s.
