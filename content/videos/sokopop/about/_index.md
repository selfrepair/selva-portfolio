# about şokopop

praised for its **unique style**, **intensive archival research**, **captivating narration**, and **deep historical context**, şokopop was founded by ekim acun in summer 2018. he was soon joined by a small collaborative team to produce content about turkish popular history and culture.

## our mission

the 90s and 2000s saw tremendous changes due to information technologies and the transformed economic and political landscape of turkey. sometimes going as far back as the late ottoman period, şokopop investigated these changes through **popular stories and figures**.

in a society where every bit of culture was being erased and forgotten, filled with information overload and manipulation of the past, showcasing footage of a bellydancer dancing on national tv in 1993 could be quite political.

we were also an **openly queer channel** in an increasingly homophobic country, which brought both unique perspectives and significant challenges.

## the collaborative process

şokopop operated as a **small, close-knit team** where roles extended across many functions. for the project, i contributed:

- **archival and academic research**
- **script writing and editing** 
- **video editing and post-production**
- **event management**
- **collaborative content development**

we even created board games (kutu oyunu) and designed t-shirts together - the team's creativity extended far beyond video production.

## audience impact & recognition

despite never achieving mainstream fame, şokopop generated **high engagement rates** and passionate audience responses. typical comments included:

> *"i'm sure even these people know these details"*

> *"you should put this on netflix"*

these responses showed we were successfully making **complex historical research accessible** while maintaining academic rigor.

## team dynamics & public presence

my friend and colleague **ekim acun** became the public face of the channel, though he always emphasized that şokopop was collaborative teamwork, not individual achievement. due to privacy concerns, i mostly stayed out of public appearances, with some exceptions.

## media coverage & interviews

şokopop's impact extended beyond youtube metrics to broader cultural conversations:

### interviews & press coverage

## challenges & transitions

due to increasing **self-censorship pressures** and **decreasing corporate partnerships** (resulting from both financial crisis and our open queer identity), the project became increasingly difficult to sustain. these challenges, combined with the political climate, influenced my decision to move to germany in 2022.



*şokopop represented a unique experiment in **storytelling** that successfully bridged academic research with popular engagement. the project's impact extended far beyond view counts to influence broader conversations about turkish cultural memory and representation.*
