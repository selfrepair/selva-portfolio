# sezen aksu vs yıldız tilbe: blood feud
*february 2021 • 5 episodes + 1 bonus • 130 minutes total • 4 million views*

this was a passion project of mine that i dreamt of for years during my teens. for me, it was about a political and sociological story which showcased the emergence of the turkish pop music industry, the liberalization of the 1990s, and entertainment industries changed by emerging technologies and liberal laws - shown through the lives of 2 icons of turkish pop music, who were not talking to each other for years despite their intimacy and connection before.

sezen aksu is probably the most famous and impactful singer and songwriter in turkish pop music with her emotional ballads and pop songs, not only that she sang but also gave to other singers since the 1970s. she is known for raising other generations of singers and collaborating with highly talented musicians. tilbe was one of them, first meeting her while singing in a local bar and then becoming her vocalist and living with her and other musicians in a house in istanbul. later she was kicked out from this house due to her affair with aksu's ex, and she started to pen her songs that kicked her into stardom. she has suffered from the fame and became the first public figure that was arrested for marijuana use. she later became known for her eccentric personality, honesty, and emotionally charged songs.

## the research process

i proposed this project while applying to şokopop, arguing tilbe was in love with aksu, and tilbe was shunned also due to her kurdish identity. (later i found out we are distant relatives.) they were not quite convinced, so i took several months to research my claims. as always, it expanded over only these two stars and included many other social and political events, mysterious cases, and figures of turkey's near history.

it investigates urban legends and gossips about the life of two stars based on extensive research and evidence and storytelling.

**exploring:**
- back in 2009, the "i rescued you from the pimps" moment was the biggest meme in turkey. tilbe was guest of the famous singer "emperor" ibrahim tatlıses show "ibo show", and by the end of the program he embarrassed her in front of millions of audience by revealing the call for help she made to him back in 1998. this scandal was also the end of the ibo show. the pimps he was mentioning were actually other producers, but this sexist and horrific sentence stuck to many people. i was bothered by this, so i wanted to do a bonus episode on this infamous tv show episode that could be found fully online
- it only took one week to make but due to its entertaining moments and the fame of the event and people, this is one of the most watched episodes of the channel
