# ebru gündeş: the young princess of fantezi music
*march 2021 • 5 episodes • 136 minutes total • 1.93 million views*

the story of singer ebru gündeş was interesting for several reasons: her name was in an international money laundering case through her sensational husband **reza zarrab**. she was from a working-class background, loved by millions, especially after her public brain hemorrhage on live tv, and after this marriage she was shied away from the public eye, except for 1-2 concerts a year.

her fame spans not only turkey, but the whole middle east region. still to this day i meet people from the region who say they love her as a conversation opener.

## the research process

for this project i contacted a mega-fan of gündeş, and he trusted us to share his extensive archives. due to that, the series had immersive video archival footage that is not present online.

we imagined the series as a form of fairytale, starting from her childhood to her tragic health situation on tv, ignoring the second part of her life after 2000. this required deep research and an episode about her marriage with iranian businessman reza zarrab, who is currently under the witness protection program in the usa under a different name.

i still have a draft that i want to publish in the future as a bonus episode that investigates her relationship with zarrab and their corruption scandal.

## personal reflection

*after this series, i decided to move to germany for certain. the self-censorship i felt during creating this series was very depressing for me. i was also feeling very limited with our capabilities, due to our team becoming only a few people now. around the same time, we had a chance to meet controversial popular figure yeşim salkım for a non-released interview project. she shared a horrible abuse story involving another very famous woman singer. then she added, "you are young and smart, go travel the world. don't bother with these things - it's too deep and dirty." this was coming from too powerful a source to ignore.*
